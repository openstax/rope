# RAISE Onboarding Portal Experience (ROPE)

ROPE aims to streamline the onboarding of RAISE adopters.

## Development

The repo includes a `docker` environment which can be launched as follows:

Set yourÂ `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `MOODLE_URL`, and `MOODLE_TOKEN` as desired using the following commands:

```bash
$ export GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<client_id>
$ export MOODLE_URL=<moodle_url>
$ export MOODLE_TOKEN=<moodle_token>
```

```bash
$ docker compose up --build -d
```

Once running, the application components can be accessed at the following URLs:

* Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
* Backend API (docs): [http://localhost:3000/api/docs](http://localhost:3000/api/docs)

A user can be added to the database by running the following command:
```bash
$ docker compose exec postgres psql -U pguser -d ropedb -c "INSERT INTO user_account (email, is_manager, is_admin, created_at, updated_at) VALUES ('user@email.com', false, true, now(), now());"
```

Devs can also test the deployment build of the frontend by running the following:

```bash
$ ROPE_APP_TARGET=deploy docker compose up --build -d
```

When developing backend code, developers may want to install the package in an editable virtual environment. That can be done as follows (to avoid unresolved imports per [this issue](https://github.com/microsoft/pylance-release/issues/3473)). If the imports remain unresolved, the language server may need to be restarted:

```bash
$ pip install -e .[test] --config-settings editable_mode=strict
```

Code coverage reports can be generated when running tests:

```bash
$ pytest --cov=rope --cov-report=term --cov-report=html
```
